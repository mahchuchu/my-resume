    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Coming from a background in Computer Science and IT, I found myself driven
      by the need to be of service to others. My experience ranges from
      aggregating data for predictive reports in Excel to establishing strong
      online presences as a Web Developer.

      Throughout my career, I've been able to quickly learn and efficiently use
      various software to complete the tasks at hand. Currently, I am studying
      for the Comptia Network+ exam to further solidify my IT knowledge and
      skillset.
    </p>
